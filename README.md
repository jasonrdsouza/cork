# Cork
A minimalist personal static site generator.

This is an attempt to write the simplest possible static site generator that satisfies my own personal use cases and needs. It is not meant as a general purpose solution, and common site generation features which I don't use have been purposefully left out. *Use at your own risk*

## Todo
- Add tests
- Publish to Pub
- add Pub visible documentation
  - static site layout (web/templates, etc)
  - supported formats (markdown, mustache, etc)
